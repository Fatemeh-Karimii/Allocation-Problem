## Allocation-Problem

###
The firefighting organization is considering the construction of fire stations in 6 cities. The distances of these 6 cities are shown in Table 1. The cost of constructing the station in these 6 cities is shown in Table 2. The organization wants to have a station at a maximum distance of 15 km from each of the cities, and at the same time, the total cost of building the stations should be minimized. First, this problem was modeled as a linear programming problem, and then the number, location, and total cost of the construction stations were determined by using the Solver plugin in Excel software.
